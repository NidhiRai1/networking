//mesh topology - 
----advantages
if n no. of ports then n*(n-1)/2 cable 
dat transfer ak issue in hoga 
point to pint link so security is high
fault can be predicted
----disadvantages -
due to high ports cost and maintance is high 

//star topology - it has a hub  and through that all the posts are connected

//hub topology - 

//ring topology - we use repeter and terminater are use with that device are connected , and repeter are use to avoid the data loss
     in general the dat flow is unidirectional 
    token ring passing protocal is use

//tree topology - star + bus topology combination , secondary hub is connected to central hub
----advantages 
distance travel is very low 
error detection and error correction is possible
-----disadvantages 
costly
